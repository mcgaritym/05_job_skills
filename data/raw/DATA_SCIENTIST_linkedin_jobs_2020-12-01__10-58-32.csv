We are working to fix market failures, shape future health markets and shift policy and funding to better support consumer empowered healthcare. There are over 7,000 PSI'ers around the world. We are a diverse group of entrepreneurial development professionals with a wide range of backgrounds and experience. All with unique skills that we bring to the critically important work that we do. Join us! PSI seeks an innovative Data Analysis Advisor to provide technical leadership for high quality, relevant, and insightful analyses across an array of data workstreams in Uganda and Nigeria. This position is a key part of the Evidence and Learning team in the DISC project-- a $18-million five-year self care project made possible with the generous support of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF). The DISC project is working with consumers, healthcare providers, governments and health systems in Nigeria and Uganda to catalyze voluntary self-injection of DMPA-SC contraceptives and promote additional forms of self-care. The investment aims to better understand the conditions under which consumers and providers will demand self-care interventions, and the feasibility of delivering high quality, cost-effective self-care services at scale. As a flagship project of PSI, we are part of PSI's organizational pursuit of universal health coverage through innovative and sustainable solutions that meet the actual health needs of people in low and middle income countries. We believe all people can and should have control of their sexuality, sexual health and fertility and that this is best achieved when people have greater voice, choice and agency over the processes and services that most affect them. Our mission is clear: every woman and girl - and every man and boy - should have access to the products, information and services they need to plan for the families, and lives, they desire. Access to quality-assured contraception and safe abortion where it is legal is part of that package. Our evidence and learning objectives align with this. How can we know if we're reaching - and satisfying - clients and consumers with quality care and products that meet their needs? How can we be sure we're on the right track to meet our commitments both to innovation as well as sustainable impact? How can we use data and evidence to understand our clients' journeyboth between the public and private outlets on which they rely, and as they self inject and self-manage their SRH? How can we ensure we use our diverse data streamsdigital, DHIS2 and HMIS, and research-- to continuously improve our programs, and tell our story with a rigor that responds to our and our technical community's most pressing questions? How can we use our evidence to inspire, and to achieve even more? We're looking for someone who loves to dig deep into the data and evidence-- to triangulate, to understand the technical 'ahas!' that are taking shape, and to enable their team members to join them in this dynamic learning journey. Experience with multi-country projects emphasizing data use for adaptation and learning, familiarity working across public and private sectors, sexual and reproductive health programs, ethics, data visualization, and digital platforms will all be parts of this position. We're looking for someone who is a data scientist at heart, and is eager to lead in taking evidence use to the 'next level' to advance self care as a new, consumer-powered cornerstone of sexual and reproductive health care.
