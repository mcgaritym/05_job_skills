Brain Trauma Research Scientist*,Odyssey Systems,"Silver Spring, MD",23 hours ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"['', 'WORKING LOCATIONS & ADDITIONAL INFO:', ' Work with a multidisciplinary team of research scientists and technicians to determine what pathological characteristics are measurable in the acute, subacute, and chronic periods following Penetrating or Ballistic brain injury. The results of these studies should refine our animal models of military relevant brain injury by better understanding the comorbidities during the sub-acute and chronic timeframe after injury. In addition, these studies will determine if it is possible to modulate outcomes based on affecting metabolic regulation and neuroplasticity in the injured brain. Areas of study by the multidisciplinary team include: Determine what pathological characteristics are measurable in the acute, subacute, and chronic periods following Projectile Concussive Impact (PCI) TBII. The expected result of this research effort is to deliver a fully characterized, validated animal model of close head concussive mild TBI. The model is expected to provide a research tool to study treatment strategies ranging from simple rest (i.e. sleep enhancement), rehab (physical and social enrichment), and therapeutics. Determine what pathological characteristics are measurable in the acute, subacute, and chronic periods following polytrauma to refine our animal models of TBI. In addition, these studies will determine if it is possible to modulate outcomes based on affecting metabolic regulation and neuroplasticity in the injured brain. Develop novel treatment strategies aimed at examining the technical feasibility of modulating neuroplasticity through the understanding of cerebral metabolic regulation and the use of environmental enrichment to modulate the effects of brain injury to better understand neurorehabilitation strategies of clinical recovery. Evaluate resuscitation strategies in polytrauma associated with TBI. Patients are faced with worse outcomes and increased morbidity when TBI occurs in conjunction with hemorrhage. Local tissue damage and systemic inflammatory responses induced by hemorrhagic shock resulting in hypoperfusion, decreased oxygen delivery, excitotoxicity, and perturbed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, all of which account for the vulnerability of the injured brain to hypotensive insults. The results of these studies should refine our animal models of military relevant brain injury by better understanding the co-morbidities during the sub-acute and chronic timeframe after injury. In addition, these studies will determine if it is possible to modulate outcomes based on affecting metabolic regulation and neuroplasticity in the injured brain. Determine whether individual therapy or a combination of therapies, such as, but not limited to, pharmacologic (novel drugs and drug combinations) and cellular (stem and stromal cells) therapies, as well as the manipulation of physical conditions (brain cooling and intracranial pressure), have measurable efficacy on established injury deficits in the acute, subacute, and chronic periods following TBI (PBBI, PCI, or polytrauma). It is expected that these studies will identify novel drugs or treatment strategies that can be used alone or in combination to prevent or attenuate the incidence of acute and delayed clinical sequel associated with experimental TBI thereby enhancing neuroprotection and improving patient morbidity after a TBI.
