Supply Dynamics enables customers to reduce the cost of raw materials and component parts that go into their products, characterize and quantify risks, anticipate disruptions before they happen, enhance collaboration with supply chain stakeholders, and ensure that the timely purchase and supply of material-inputs is NEVER the reason parts are late to an end-use customer or in-field requirement.', 'Act as a key technical contributor on a SaaS application built on Grails, with a focus on Hibernate.', 'localization requirements', 'Good communication and interpersonal skills', 'Who Are We? \xa0', 'Website:', 'Part Attribute Characterization (PAC) is an ITAR compliant software-driven engineering service that delivers reliable, structured, bill-of-material information about the raw materials and COTS components that go into a customer’s products, equipment or weapons systems. The resulting output can then be used to classify parts by attribute (e.g. manufacturing processes, material type, special processes, finishes, sizes, etc.), determine opportunities to standardize raw material sizes and specifications, and identify equivalency relationships across multiple part numbers with same form, fit, and function. Importantly, this process utilizes a customer’s existing engineering drawings as the starting point and DOES NOT rely on lengthy and error prone supplier surveys.\xa0SDX makes a company’s daily supply chain interactions with suppliers visible, allowing the sharing of vital material and processing information to all stakeholders happen real- time. With this new intelligence, companies can use SDX’s intuitive user interface to choreograph and monitor the timely purchase and supply of material-inputs and related processes across all tiers of their supply chain, giving them the ability to, among other things: consolidate common raw material and process purchases with fewer suppliers; lower costs; quantify risks; drive material and process standardization and supplier rationalization; find new supply sources; benchmark pricing; identify hedging opportunities; and last but not least, identify potential supply disruptions weeks and months before they happen. The result? Lower production costs (which in all cases equates to higher profit margins), fewer stock-outs, more secure, resilient and responsive supply chains! Benefits are recognized within weeks of implementation, and importantly, SDX does NOT require the customer to change or modify any existing IT or ERP systems.', 'business collaboration platform, designed for', 'Website:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0www.supplydynamics.com ', 'Interest and experience in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence is a plus', 'Web application development experience', 'Supply Dynamics Inc., is an Ohio based business founded in 2003 and backed (in 2017) by Queen City Angels, Cincinnati, and Rev 1 Ventures, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Responsibilities Include', 'months before they happen', 'structured']",Entry level,Full-time,Engineering,Computer Software,2020-09-15 09:02:16
