The individual will be a key participant in the establishment and implementation of a Data Analytics Strategy within PI.This role requires the knowledge to set up a logical workflow to identify the location of data in various databases and then to relate the data into a visualization and modeling-ready dataset. Boston Scientific’s data are located in both on-premises Enterprise Data Hub and in cloud locations that include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Redshift. On-premises data will eventually be completely migrated to cloud warehouses. A good understanding of general data architecture will help to learn the BSC schemas and data access permissions.
