Our team includes engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, economists and social scientists – a rock-star data scientist can come from any academic field.', 'You will be responsible for leading the data science efforts for one of the biggest in-app programmatic exchange in the world. This involves project ideation and conceptualization, solution design, measurement and solution iteration, coaching, deployment and post deployment management.', 'This will also include designing, development, testing of product experiments. You will need to guide the team in practical experiments, product design, model development and model evaluation. It is vital to be agile and iterate fast across experiment to deliver go-to-market ready products.', 'You are expected to be a hands-on part of the role where you will also actively analyse data, design and develop models, and problem-solve solutions with the rest of the team.', 'Additionally stakeholder management is needed.
