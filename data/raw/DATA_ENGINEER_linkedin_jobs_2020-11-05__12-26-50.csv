As DSHS works to provide this critical data to inform decision makers, health care administrators and citizens, the agency is experiencing serious limitations in the ability to efficiently and reliably provide the data due to a legacy of disparate systems and data that currently resides in numerous locations and databases across the agency. Sharing this vital data across all of these systems is inherently difficult, time-consuming, and requires resource intensive manual and inefficient processes. These cumbersome manual processes have a severe impact on Texas\' ability to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the loss of life.The Infectious Disease Data Integration (IDDI) project is intended to improve the efficiency of current processes. An integrated approach to data services will aid in providing the most current data to inform decision makers about the health and readiness statuses of jurisdictions across the state.The Infectious Disease Data Integration project aims to create a data analytics platform plus data governance with Informatica Axon. The IDDI platform will facilitate the sharing, reporting, and analytics of the data collected from the COVID-19 contact tracing in the Texas Health Trace (THT) system, the COVID-19 case management data contained in the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS), and COVID-19 immunization tracking in the ImmTrac system.All work products resulting from the project shall be considered  ""works made for hire” and are the property of the HHSC.
