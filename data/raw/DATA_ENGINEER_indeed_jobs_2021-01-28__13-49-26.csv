Preference is given in competitive appointments as well as special noncompetitive appointments. Only veterans discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge) are eligible for veterans preference.There are three types of preference eligible:Disabled, regardless of the rating;Non-Disabled; andSole survivorship preferenceThe preference eligibles are divided into five basic groups:CPS - Disability rating of 30% or more (10 points)CP - Disability rating of at least 10% but less than 30% (10 points)XP - Disability rating less than 10% (10 points)TP - Preference eligibles with no disability rating (5 points)SSP - Sole Survivorship Preference (0 points)This announcement is only accepting application from disabled, 10-point veterans with CPS, CP, or XP preference. Other preference groups (TP and SSP) may apply to our VRA-specific announcement to avoid being found ineligible. For more information on the types of veterans preference, visit the Feds Hire Vets Veterans Preference web page.SPECIAL HIRING AUTHORITIES FOR VETERANSBelow is a list of special hiring authorities designed specifically for veterans for which 10-point veterans may be eligible. For more information, visit the Feds Hire Vets Special Hiring Authorities for Veterans web page.Veterans Recruitment Act (VRA)VRA allows for the appointment of eligible veterans without competition from non veterans. This hiring authority can be used for positions up to GS-11 or equivalent. Veterans are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise found in competitive service. After the individual satisfactorily completes 2 years of service, the veteran must be converted non-competitively to a career or career-conditional appointment.Eligibility under the VRA hiring authority applies to any of the following veterans:Disabled veterans; orVeterans who served in active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; orVeterans who, while serving on active duty in the armed forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; orRecently separated veterans (within 3 years).In addition, veterans must be separated from the Armed Forces under honorable or general discharge.30 Percent or More Disabled VeteransThe 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans authority enables the appointment of an eligible candidate to any position for which he or she is qualified without competition. Unlike the VRA, there is no grade-level limitation. Initial appointments are time-limited, lasting more than 60 days; however, individuals can be non-competitively converted to a permanent status at any time during the time-limited appointment.Eligibility applies to the following categories:Disabled veterans who were retired from active military service with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more; orDisabled veterans rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or moreDisabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training ProgramDisabled veterans eligible for training under the Veterans Administration (VA) vocational rehabilitation program may enroll for training or work experience at an agency under the terms of an agreement between the agency and VA. While enrolled in the VA program, the veteran is not a Federal employee for most purposes, but is a beneficiary of the VA.Training is tailored to the individual's needs and goals, so there is no set length. If the training is intended to prepare the individual for eventual appointment in the agency rather than just provide work experience, the agency must ensure that the training will enable the veteran to meet the qualification requirements for the position.Upon successful completion, the host agency and VA give the veteran a Certificate of Training showing the occupational series and grade level of the position for which the veteran trained. The Certificate of Training allows any agency to appoint the veteran non-competitively under a status quo appointment which may be converted to career or career conditional at any time.Applicants wishing to be considered for employment using SSA's competitive selection process may also respond to a specific job opportunity announcement listed on SSA's job opportunity page at: https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/Results?a=SZ00&hp=public&p=1EducationProviding Proof of Education or Substituting EducationSome positions require proof of education or allow you to use your education to meet qualification requirements.
